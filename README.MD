# Introduction to Machine Learning Final Project

## Usage (for Linux)
1. Create a virtual environment for packages with venv and activate it.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install required packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start the project.
```bash
python project.py
```

## Steps
1. Select a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.
2. Problem Definition: Explain the problem to be solved using the selected dataset.
3. Dataset Source: Indicate where the dataset was collected and which platform it was obtained from.
4. Number of Examples: Provide the total number of examples (rows) in the dataset and the number of classes (if applicable).
5. Data Preprocessing: Perform tasks such as missing data analysis, data cleaning, and formatting the data appropriately.
6. Training and Test Set Split: Divide the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% test).
7. Classification: Apply at least three different classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Networks).
8. Accuracy: Compare and analyze the accuracy of each classification method.
